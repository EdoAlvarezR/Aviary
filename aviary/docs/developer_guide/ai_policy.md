# Aviary's AI Policy
Use of generative artificial intelligence (LLMs) to produce code for Aviary is acceptable, as long as you follow the following guidelines.

## 1. Disclose use of AI

Any use of AI tools should be clearly disclosed. It is helpful to separate AI-generated code into their own commits, but not always possible. Mention that AI was used in the commit messages. Give additional details in your pull request descriptions about how AI was used. Include a brief explanation of what you used the AI for (debugging, generating new code, etc.), which model you used, and which files were affected.

## 2. Thoroughly test all AI-generated code

Like all code contributions, it is important to run all unittests and benchmark tests on as many different OS and environment configurations as you reasonably can - this goes double for any changes that used AI assistance. If any code generated by AI is not explicitly tested by a unittest, you should write a new test to cover the AI generated code. If AI modifies existing code, especially if new functionality is added, existing unittests should be extended to test that new functionality.

AI-generated documentation should be carefully checked for accuracy. [Doctape](DocTAPE) should be added to automatically test your documentation against the Aviary codebase. AI-generated documentation should also be edited to keep tone and style consistent with the rest of the Aviary documentation.

## 3. Use common sense, leverage strengths of AI

In general, you should never just accept and copy/paste code an AI tool gives you. All AI-generated code should be reviewed and understood before you commit it.

As of the time this page was written (spring of 2025), generative AI is very good at small scale tasks - writing a chunk of code to achieve a specific objective, modifying/debugging snippets of existing code, and explaining the purpose of existing code, among other things. It is not as useful for tasks that require context awareness of multiple different files, such as a refactor of a major feature. We recommend limited, targeted use of AI to speed up development time for some of those small-scale tasks. However, this advice is based on experience using current-generation AI models, and as these tools improve you should leverage their new capabilities. The key takeaway is that you should always understand your code before submitting it to Aviary no matter how it was created.

    "# Creating a Turboprop Powered Aircraft Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will create a more advanced `EngineModel`, the `TurbopropModel`. This is a complicated type of engine that combines several different models into a single unit. The `TurbopropModel` has three individual pieces needed to create it - a \"shaft power model\" that describes how the turboprop turns energy into shaft power, such as a turboshaft or motor, a \"gearbox model\" for modifying the shaft RPM, and a \"propeller model\" to convert shaft power into thrust. Let's walk through two examples: first building a turboprop with the minimum amount of required information, and then a second example where we replace individual models in the `TurbopropModel` with custom ones of our own choice.\n",
